An {{Glossary("object", "object's")}} stringifier is any {{Glossary("attribute")}} or {{Glossary("method")}} that is defined to provide a textual representation for use when the object is used in situations where a {{Glossary("string")}} is expected e.g. `console.log(anOjbect)`. Objects that don't have any defined stringifer, are usually converted to their {{Glossary("JSON")}} representation in similar situations.
